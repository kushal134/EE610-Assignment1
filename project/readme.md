# Basic Image Editor
## Instructions to Run
I am mentioning instructions to run on VS Code on Windows.

Download the given zip folder and open the project folder in VS Code. Set up the virtual environment using
`python -m venv venv`

Now Select Preferences using `Ctrl + Shift + P` and mention the path to the Scripts folder settings.json

`{

    "python.pythonPath": "C:\\<path-to-venv>\\venv\\Scripts\\python"
}`

This will set up the virtual environment. Now install the required libraries using

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
